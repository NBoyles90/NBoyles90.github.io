        </div>
        <p>
          Hi! My name is <strong>Nikki Boyles</strong>.
          I am a student currently enrolled at Ozarks Technical Community College for an associate degree in Computer Information Science.
          This revolves around my interest in video games and coding. Coincidentally, the video game that sparked my interest in coding was a survival game called
          ARK: Survival Evolved on the limited PlayStation 4 platform. A lifelong friend and fellow player (who is now a senior mobile app developer)
          is who confirmed my interest with its customizable servers. We worked together for years on our server,
          and she taught me a lot about how to work with what we had available to us.
          My husband of ten years and my beautiful daughter have always been very supportive of my interests and pushed me to pursue higher education.
        </p>

        <p>
          I have had a wide variety of jobs in the past. I succeeded in obtaining my Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA) though the Vocational Technical Program (Vo-Tech) in my high school.
          I did a brief 5 year stint in the Marine Corps as an I level Aircraft Mechanic, working on structures and composites for all the aircraft under the Marine aircraft
          group 2nd MAW MAG-14 MALS-14 at MCAS Cherry Point. I also have job experience in Medical Billing and Coding, a Key Holder at a Vapor Shop and an Assistant Manager at a
          local pizzeria, and briefly worked in the mental heath field in south-west Missouri.
        </p>

        <h4>My Time in the Marine Corps</h4>
        <p>As a teenager I was very indecisive as of what I wanted to be when I grew up. I took the questionnaires and they always placed me in positions of caring or teaching others. I thought that meant I was destined to be a nurse or a doctor so
          while in high school I chose the CNA program. In college though I knew that I was not cut out for nursing, the classes overwhelmed me, and I did not find any joy in what I was learning. Confused and feeling trapped in my current situation I
          decided to enlist in the Marine Corps (which was inspired by a good friend of mine who had recently ended his enlistment.) They were helpful and listened to my desires for the future and I was excited because the only thing I wanted to do
          while enlisted was to learn how to weld. Unfortunately, I never had the chance to learn to weld because once pregnant I was sent away from the workshop to work behind a desk and input the other Marine’s training data. While there I was
          injured and put on a permanent light duty so I could not return to my workshop. Because of my proficiency in navigating their systems and precise data entry the higher ups offered me a position that typically a Sergeant or higher would
          normally fill (I was trapped as a Lance Corporal because I could not complete the physical requirements to make the next rank of Corporal). I took the opportunity because as a Ground Safety Officer I knew that I would gain knowledge and
          skills that would help me in the ‘civilian world’. <small> Please see my resume for more details about the position. </small> I enjoyed my time in Ground Safety and thrived under the pressure of keeping up with 50 buildings/workshops. I
          learned there that I enjoy being challenged and problem solving. It also helped me learn that I enjoy especially working with programs like excel and I became quite proficient at utilizing it’s functions.</p>

        <h4>My Hobbies</h4>
        <p>I have always had many different hobbies and if I had to list them all I would say that my hobby is learning. I have dabbled in cross stitch, knitting, graphic design, 3d models, work working, metal smithing, building fish tanks and sump
          tanks, making small intricately designed coils for vaping (while I worked at the vape store), photo editing, and much more. Reading is more than a hobby, its part of my routine every day and has been since high school. I was always that kid
          in the library pouring over a book and my friends and I even had a little impromptu book club where we would sit and discuss the latest books we were reading or even writing. As life is now, it is hard to find time to sit and read so I have
          been using Audible more often lately. I love being outdoors, camping and fishing is probably my favorite past time and especially during the fall I try to go as often as possible. I discovered my love of video games in my early 20s, video
          games have always been a part of my family life, but my older brother always had control of the only console we had at the time. My husband begged and pleaded with me to try Destiny with him and after a while I gave it a shot. I was
          instantly in love with it and played it constantly, almost to my detriment. The story was thrilling and the friends I made during the raids are still some of my best friends today! They’ve been a big part of shaping who I am today and I am
          eternally grateful to my husband for convincing me to try out video games one more time.</p>

        <h4>My Family</h4>
        <p>I have a very interesting family dynamic, I am the youngest of my mother’s 3 children and I have 1 younger brother (Joshua, who just turned 18. We recently met for the first time and I have to say I am quite proud of him! He is my adorable
          baby brother and we have so many things in common!) from my father. I have 3 step siblings, and we were all grown up by the time our parents got married. When you combine my mother and my stepmother’s kids, Austin is the youngest, so I have
          lost my place as the baby of the family (welcome to the joys of being a middle child). My mom and dad were in the navy when they met and had me, so it was interesting being a military brat and moving all over the place, even if I was too
          young to remember. I remember the stories though and love hearing about them. My mom got into gaming as soon as she could buy her first console and some of my earliest memories are of her beating levels for my brother or scolding us for
          mishandling the Nintendo cartridges. She is a big nerd and even today she always has her little tv and console (she recently upgraded to PS4, getting fancy now) by her recliner. My family has always been a fantastic support system, we all
          fight and bicker but there is always love and when push comes to shove, we all have each other’s back and do our best to help when difficult situations arise.
          My husband, Brad, and I have a 9-year-old little girl, Rayne, and we will be celebrating our 10-year anniversary in June! Brad is my best friend and my biggest supporter to figuring out what I wanted to do with myself for the future. When I
          expressed my desire to go to college he cheered and has been helping and supporting me each semester. I tend to stick with one project, but he encourages me to branch out and see what else I can do. I would not be where I am today without
          him.
